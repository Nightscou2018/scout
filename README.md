scout
=====

Scout (name subject to change) is a UI shim for viewing continuous glucose monitor data from [Nightscout](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor), in a simplified and prettier form. It may grow to incorporate a backend component, but it currently only depends on cross-origin request access to the domain on which Nightscout is running.
